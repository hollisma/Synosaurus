# TODO
* Figure out how to run python scripts in js/react and also how to get the input/outputs
* Write the python script to return a list of significant words and their synonyms (use NLTK)

* Render the significant words as buttons and other words normally
* Click button => bring up tooltip/menu that contains synonyms
* Selecting word changes curText and renders new buttons/text

* Styling

* Additional features like downloading as txt, copying to pastebin, sharing, etc
* Can also do some NLP and do sentiment analysis, analyze dialog to see which character says what
