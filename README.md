# TODO
* Render the significant words as buttons and other words normally
* Click button => bring up tooltip/menu that contains synonyms
* Selecting word changes curText and renders new buttons/text

* Styling

* Should improve the synonym searching. Right now, it only gets basic nouns and root verbs. 
* Additional features like downloading as txt, copying to pastebin, sharing, etc
* Can also do some NLP and do sentiment analysis, analyze dialog to see which character says what
