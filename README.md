# How to install
This app is running at [synthesaurus.surge.sh], but if you want to run it locally, here's what I did: \
First, clone the repo and run npm install. Then there are some scripts in package.json to format and stuff. 
Run 'npm run build' to create a dist folder, then to run locally, run 'npm run start'. To get it hosted with
Surge, install surge and run 'surge' and authenticate yourself, choose the dist folder, then choose the url. 


# TODO
* Styling

* Additional features like downloading as txt, copying to pastebin, sharing, etc
* Can also do some NLP and do sentiment analysis, analyze dialog to see which character says what
